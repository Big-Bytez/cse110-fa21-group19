**Discussion:**  
-Testing
-CI/CD docs
-Add test cases for mvp.
-Automate deployment.(Every time you make changes in github it deploys to netlify)



**Conclusions:**
Hema recommendations:
-Hide overflow
-Change feed so it doesn't show same recipes all the time.(maybe by rating)
-Feed is not time accurate(15 mins in under 10 min section).
-Make searching recipes more consistent(cook time vs max time)
-Add pictures to home page to make it more attractive.
-Anchor search bar and logo because overlap is bad.
-Need to write backend to transfer recipe data to recipe page.(Push name of recipe to local storage->fetch call->data in json replaces recipe page)
-Make nav bar show types of cuisine instead of what we have now. 
-Have show more button to show more recipes in each section.
-Make filters check boxes:(Maybe after MVP)
Cuisine:
  American []
  Indian  []
  Mexican[]
Protein:
  Chicken []
  Beef []
Time:
10 minutes []
20 minutes []
30 minutes []
-Prioritize normal search then 3 homepage buttons.
-Maybe add images in button to make more visually appealing. Red circles seem a little plain.
-Think more about three button features:
`-Make single step (10 minute eggs) rather than 2 step where you click time and then eggs.


Pending for MVP:
-Feed prettier no overlap
-Search page integrated with search bar
-User page and favorite working
-Recipe page backend.
(Prioritize Feed and Recipe Page)

## Conclusion: ##
-Prioritize search and feed to get mvp done.
-Reorganize group assignments to get more done.
-Have a call to see what we want to keep and drop for the MVP.
