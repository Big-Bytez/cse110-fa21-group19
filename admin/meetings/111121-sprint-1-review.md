# Group 19 Sprint Review Meeting #
## Date: 11/11/2021 ##
## Location: Warren Mall 3 ##
     Note Taker: Xi-Kai Wu
     
## Overview ##
We started the sprint by splitting our group into two groups of one focused on HTML and another on Java Script, and then splitting up into pairs inside the groups. We found that our strategy allowed us to quickly design and implement our frontend and backend components, and ensured that everyone had a job to do. However some issues that we encountered were the uniformity of our design and communication between the backend team interms of which features were needed from Spoonacular. Additionally we failed to allocate tasks for the CICD pipeline and had to assign additional roles towards the end of the sprint. For future sprint we intented to do a better job of communication, and making sure that everyone on the team is aware of a bigger picture.

## Liza and Kai ##
Designed and implemented the reusable components such as the Recipe tiles that will be reused on the pages. Got the design to fit the spoonacular API and automatically generate the thumbnails by grabbing the data needed based on query(See example for "Pasta Under an Hour" below). Also researched and completed a demo for local storage.
