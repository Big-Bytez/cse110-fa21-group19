A: Yes, in chat\
Project Layout: \
- W4,5 -> design phase
- W5,6,7 -> Sprint 1 / MVP
- W8,9,10 -> Sprint 2 / Additional Features

### Grading###

**Discussion:**  
Based on:
- project and functionality
- Communication within team (as determined by Hema's observations)
- Classroom participation
- Half of Team should show up at each discussion
- How well we remain git repo, naming conventions
    Have someone lead maintaining the github for naming, folder structure, etc. 
* To get an A: Recipe must stand out in some way with its  features
  If we make a simple app that is functional and has basic domain-spec features it will recieve a B

Q: Will we recieve feedback from TA about our work throughout the project
A: Yes, Hema will give feedback

### Agenda Item: Beginning Brainstorming ###

**Discussion:**  
It should be UCD, user-driven. Consider potential users, target users, and what they want to see in the app
Identify users first!
Comparing with existing apps in very important
Brainstorming phase is also very important as it will lay out the future of the app
Everyone should do brainstorming before next meetup-come up with unique features, and flawed features from other apps
Think about the 5 W's and H. Answer them to help with brainstorming
-It will take place in the kitchen,so:
    should be easy to read
    low touch app
    maybe read out the instructions - text to speech
Who do we WANT to target?
    -meal prepperes?
    -home-style cooks who just want a nice meal
-Next step after designing features is categorizing features
    sprint 1: essential feats
    sprint 2: low effort feats 
    sprint 3: high effort feats
-How are we going to get all these recipes in the manager?
    -get them from online sources (needed to have a wide variet of recipes)
        -consider looking for API to easily input recipes, maybe a data scraper
    -add recipe manually
-sorting recipes:
    -difficulty
    -time
    -cuisine
    -nutrition (high protein, low carb, etc)
-use tags for filtering 
-Look at non-recipe apps
ie) google maps has text-to-speech
iie) netflix/tinder have swipe right feats

How will our app be different than googling a recipe?
(Remember Google is our competitor)
-we will have a favorites feature 
-we can cater to a specific audience - drawback: loses market share, narrows audience
-more advanced filtering options
-Google is more read-only, we will be more CRUD!
-recipe modifications!!! (update!)
-google has all different formats, we should have all uniform formats
**Conclusions:**

Brainstorming assignment due next monday: 
- Let Hema know if we want to go over assignment next Sunday(and cancel Tues meet) before submitting, let her know by Friday
- Immedietly begin Design Documents after Brainstorming
- Next step-> pitch using pitch document- consider Hema the stakeholder, and we must pitch the app to her
    -This includes all of the essential info, risks, audience, etc.
