          <li>In a large bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt.  In another large bowl, beat butter and sugar together</li>
          <li>Add egg, milk, and vanilla and beat until combined, then add flour mixture gradually until just combined</li>
          <li>Shape into a disk and wrap in plastic</li>
          <li>Refrigerate 1 hour</li>
          <li>When ready to roll, preheat oven to 350º and line two large baking sheets with parchment. Lightly flour a clean work surface and roll out dough until 1/8” thick</li>
          <li>Using a ghost cookie cutter, cut out cookies</li>

Place about 1/4 of icing into a small bowl and dye black with black food coloring.  Place about half the white icing in a piping bag fitted with a small round tip and pipe edges around cookies.   Thin remaining white icing by adding 1 teaspoon milk at a time until icing runs easily on cookies, but isn't water thin</li>
          <li>Place icing in another piping bag with a small round tip and fill in centers of cookies</li>
          <li>Use a toothpick to pop any air bubbles and to spread icing to help fill any gaps</li>
          <li>Let cookies dry until icing is set, 15 minutes.  Place black icing in a piping bag with a small round tip and pipe eyes and mouths onto cookies. </li>
