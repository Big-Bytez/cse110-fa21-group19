## Context and Problem Statement

As a group, we decided that we wanted to create a "stand-out" feature that would be related to how we present our brand. Previously, 
we were named Big Bytes. 

## Decision Drivers 

* We wanted to try to target a specific audience (Professor reccomendation), while also being open enough for other users (Hema's reccommendation). The group
that we thought of were hungry college students, and we opened up that idea by including people with little time to cook.
* As a result, we decided on features that would focus on quick recipes!

## Considered Options

* Keep Big Bytes
* Change to Quick Bytes

## Decision Outcome

Changed to Quick Bytes, because this allows us to create features that would cater towards our target group. It would also create a "stand out" feature where 
people would come to our site for a simple UI that would find them quick recipes!

## Context and Problem Statement

We wanted to have a rough idea of what our front page would look like. What kind of User Interface would be user-friendly and accessible for all potential users?

## Decision Drivers 

* Something quick and accessible!

## Considered Options

* An open page where users could browse for recipes
* For quick and accessible, users will have to navigate to an under 20 min category
* Users are prompted with 4 simple choices: 1 - 5 minutes, 2 - 10 minutes, 3 - 20 minutes, 4 - A search bar

## Decision Outcome

Option 3. This helps signify our choices to why we needed to re-brand. By creating a simple UI, users are able to quickly choice HOW much time they have for their
next meal. We also decided to modify this choice by doing <5 minutes, <10 minutes and <20 minutes, creating a more accessible and user-friendly site. By including the
search bar, we allow for users to search for specific recipes that they are interested in, rather than locking them in for specific time frames. 

We found that many recipe sites are too focused on showing tens of different recipes on their main page. It got very confusing and frightening to try to find a recipe 
that a normal user could make. Not only that, their website UI was confusing! The best accessible one that interested us was epicurious, and is what helped influence our design.
