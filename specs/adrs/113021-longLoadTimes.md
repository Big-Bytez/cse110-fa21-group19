## Context and Problem Statement

The API calls to getting the search results for the recipes were taking a bit longer than users would expect. It could cause users to think that the recipe manager is not working
and as a result, leave the page D:.

## Decision Drivers 

* Users leaving is bad.
* Blank screen can be confusing, could be long load times or even the API calls ran out.

## Considered Options

* Leave as is
* Have a loading bar
* Create a fun and exciting branding loading screen!

## Decision Outcome

Liza decided to create a fun and exciting loading screen that continues our fun theme of burgers. We now have the ability to let users know that the API calls are loading 
and that our site is indeed working. Spinning burgers!
