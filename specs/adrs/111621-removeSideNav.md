**Update(11/23):** We decided to transition away from the cuisine filter to an actual filters bar. However, rather than adding it again on all of the pages, it is kept only
on the search page. This way, we can have the option to filter the recipes, while also not cluttering the home, recipe and user page.

# Removing side nav for MVP

* Status: Accepted
* Deciders: 
  - Everyone
* Date: 11-16-2021

## Context and Problem Statement

We were approaching the deadline for our MVP demostration and we have yet to complete the necessary code for the side nav. We currently have a non-functioning bar on 
all of our pages.

## Decision Drivers 

* We needed to show complete features, as described by Hema.
* It would not be an MVP if there were missing pieces. 
* This is something that we could expand later on in the following weeks.

## Considered Options

* Comment out the text and keep the red bar
* Comment out the entire red bar
* Quickly focus our attention to completing the bar

## Decision Outcome

We decided to comment out the side nav for the entire page. If we were to focus our full attention on the bar, we would be ignoring the functionality of other aspects
in our site that needed to be worked out. They were more important!
