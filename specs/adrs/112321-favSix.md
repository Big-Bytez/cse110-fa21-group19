## Context and Problem Statement

For our MVP, we capped the number of favorited recipes to 6. However, users could want to favorite more, and want more usability! 

## Decision Drivers 

* It is true that 6 recipes is NOT enough
* Once more than 6 is favorited, some will no longer display if another is added.
* I want MORE crying burgers D:

## Considered Options

*  Only allow users to add 6 recipes
*  Allow a show more button that shows 6 more
*  Create a variable flex box that can fit more and more favorites

## Decision Outcome

The decision concluded was to create a variable flex box that would simply increase the size as more recipes were shown. As a result, we can continue to have the crying burger
at the end of all the recipes to encourage users to favorite MORE!
