## Context and Problem Statement

We wanted to have a rough idea of what our front page would look like. What kind of User Interface would be user-friendly and accessible for all potential users?

## Decision Drivers 

* Something quick and accessible!

## Considered Options

* An open page where users could browse for recipes
* For quick and accessible, users will have to navigate to an under 20 min category
* Users are prompted with 4 simple choices: 1 - 5 minutes, 2 - 10 minutes, 3 - 20 minutes, 4 - A search bar

## Decision Outcome

Option 3. This helps signify our choices to why we needed to re-brand. By creating a simple UI, users are able to quickly choice HOW much time they have for their
next meal. We also decided to modify this choice by doing <5 minutes, <10 minutes and <20 minutes, creating a more accessible and user-friendly site. By including the
search bar, we allow for users to search for specific recipes that they are interested in, rather than locking them in for specific time frames. Of course, if the user 
wanted to **NOT** choose a time frame, we allow the functionality of scrolling down and finding a unfiltered list!

We found that many recipe sites are too focused on showing tens of different recipes on their main page. It got very confusing and frightening to try to find a recipe 
that a normal user could make. Not only that, their website UI was confusing! The best accessible one that interested us was epicurious, and is what helped influence our design.
