## Context and Problem Statement

We needed to decide how the pages would connect, and how users would interact with our page. 

## Decision Drivers 

* We really wanted to have our user portal because it allowed us to expand towards a possible grocery lists
* An accessible home page
* Quick and formatted site that users would not get lost in

## Considered Options

* Home Page (Redirecting to filtered/unfiltered search) -> Search Page (List of recipes) -> Recipe Page (The entire document for the recipe) -> User Portal (Collection of fav.)
* Home Page (Redirect to filtered time ONLY) -> Search Page (List - opens to full recipe) -> User Portal (Collection of fav.)
* Home Page (Search bar ONLY) -> Search Page (List of recipes) -> Recipe Page (The entire document) 

## Decision Outcome

We went with Option 1. This allows us to have a solid foundation of a MVP and gives us room to expand small features that wouldn't require a long sprint. We avoided option 2, because opening up the recipe results could cause a bigger issue in mobile users and allocating the correct space on the page.
