## Context and Problem Statement

As a group, we decided to research different recipe APIs that we could use to populate our recipe manager. Looking through the top options, we narrowed our decision 
between 3 different APIs. 

## Decision Drivers 

* We needed a API that would be simple and intuitive for our searching purposes. We needed a recipe that would have tags, a searching function, and FREE to use. 
* A popular API because it would help us find a bunch of debugging help online.
* Highly rated.
* Recommendation from Hema(our TA).

## Considered Options

* Spoonacular
* MyCookbook.io
* Tasty

## Decision Outcome

Ultimately, we decided on Spoonacular as our recipe API. This is because of the recommendation from our TA, and because of how highly rated Spoonacular is. Furthermore, they
provide the perfect service where we would not need to code our own search engine, or tagging system for our recipes. *Also, it provides a grocery list function that we could
use to expand our MVP!
